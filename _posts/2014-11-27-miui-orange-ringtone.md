It was 4 years ago, I was trying all the custom ROMs possible on my Samsung Galaxy i9003. This was one of the earliest galaxy mobiles by Samsung.

As every other developer, I was reading a thread on XDA-developers. I found that there is something called MIUI and it is a look-alike of iOS.

Wow!! This is the perfect blend! The style and beauty of iOS and features and customizability of android mixed together. I was fascinated by the ROM. I tried it. It was amazing (for the first few days). It was still in the alpha version. It screwed up my phone&#8217;s battery. MIUI is beautiful and heavily themed. I still love MIUI for the beauty!

## The MIUI Ringtone!

While using MIUI, I set my ringtone as &#8216;Orange&#8217;. I never noticed it&#8217;s melody because it sounded like just another Chinese ringtone in Chinese mobiles (no offense MIUI &#8211; made in china).

But people around me started to ask &#8220;what ringtone is that? Could you send it to me?&#8221;
  
Then I realized it really is melodious. Again a perfect blend!

Today, though I don&#8217;t use MIUI, I have kept the &#8216;Orange&#8217; ringtone with me.
