Installing Cyanogenmod is easy these days using one click installer. Many users started using CM as a daily driver. There can be problems after installing CM. Some of them are

  1. Whatsapp unable to send or receive pictures and videos.</p> 
  2. Unable to take screenshots.

  3. Unable to capture pictures.

> Error Message: Not enough storage
    
> The File manager can detect filesystem, but some apps don&#8217;t. These problems are related to storage permission.
