It&#8217;s just a game!

No. Seriously!

Whenever you see the T-Rex, click space if you&#8217;re on your laptop or touch the rex on your touch phone and the game will automatically start! Now continue using your spacebar or tapping on the dinosaur to make him jump over the cacti!

The dinosaur shows up when Chrome can&#8217;t connect to the Internet. It looks like this

The game tracks your progress and high score, but stats are lost if the window closes or is refreshed.
