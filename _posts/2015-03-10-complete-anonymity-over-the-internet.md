Complete anonymity over the internet is your right! Whatever you do online can be watched by someone who has access. This access can be authorized or unauthorized. But you are being watched! This is not a dialogue copied from &#8216;Person of Interest&#8217;, it&#8217;s true that the government is watching you, ad companies are tracking you. I have discussed <a href="http://redgadgets.com/google-knows/" title="What Google knows about you?" target="_blank">how Google tracks you</a> in the last post. You might be one of those people who consider, &#8220;I don&#8217;t really have anything to hide&#8221; principle but if you happened to be a gay activist in Uganda, tracing could lead to the end of your life!

This link below shows how an agency can track you, build a profile on you, display ads based on your searches, sell your profile to a company! Click on the below link to see how you are being watched.

Everyone has the right to read anything on the internet and not face the consequences of reading that.

Complete anonymity over internet is close to impossible but you can use some tools to be over 99% anonymous. You can be tracked at any level of connectivity. It can happen at the Wi-Fi you are connected to, your ISP or by the websites and search engines you are using. Let&#8217;s see how to avoid being watched.

### <span id="CyberGhost_VPN">CyberGhost VPN</span>

CyberGhost VPN is an internet anonymizer service provided by CyberGhost. It is a free service with a slight drop in the speed while browsing. If you are using a high speed internet, the speed drop is unnoticeable.

You can choose from a bunch of locations including the USA. This is very useful when you are trying to access websites like Hulu, Spotify etc., that are blocked in your country.

TunnelBear is another option if you are looking for a premium service.

### <span id="Tor_browser">Tor browser</span>

The Tor software protects you by bouncing your communications between a distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around the world. It also prevents somebody watching your Internet connection from learning what sites you visit, it prevents the sites you visit from accessing your physical location, and it lets you access sites which are blocked in your location.

[<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/tor-browser-redgadgtes.jpg?fit=700%2C395" alt="tor-browser-redgadgtes" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-602" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/tor-browser-redgadgtes.jpg?resize=532%2C300 532w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/03/tor-browser-redgadgtes.jpg?w=800 800w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-recalc-dims="1" />](/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/tor-browser-redgadgtes.jpg)

You don&#8217;t have to worry about the browser compatibility. It uses latest Firefox source. So it is actually a modded firefox browser.

### <span id="DuckDuckGo_Search">DuckDuckGo Search</span>

DuckDuckGo (DDG) is a search engine that emphasizes protecting searchers&#8217; privacy and avoiding the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble" target="_blank">filter bubble</a> of personalized search results.
  
That means that DuckDuckGo search engine does not keep an data you have entered in the search box unlike Google.

[<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/duckduckgo-redgadgets.jpg?fit=700%2C377" alt="duckduckgo-redgadgets" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-604" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/duckduckgo-redgadgets.jpg?resize=557%2C300 557w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/03/duckduckgo-redgadgets.jpg?w=800 800w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-recalc-dims="1" />](/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/duckduckgo-redgadgets.jpg)

If you still want to use Google search as your default search engine then logout from all Google accounts before searching anything on Google.

### <span id="Ghostery_Plugin">Ghostery Plugin</span>

Ghostery detects the trackers, web bugs, pixels, and beacons placed on web pages by Facebook, Google, and thousands of other companies interested in your activity. You can turn these trackers off, thus not giving out any information to any agencies.

This is the advanced version of MaskMe extension. Through this browser plugin you can sign up to any website without giving your real email address. Blur generates a random email to sign up with.

Hola Vpn is the best VPN solution for mobile devices. Through this application you can create a VPN in your smartphone. It is known that how easy for Google to track your location if you are carrying an Android device. By using VPN you can avoid being tracked over the phone. But you cannot mask the location if you are using GPS.
  
Hola provides a tab called &#8220;Popular in your Country&#8221; which has a bunch of apps that are not available in that particular country. You can use all those with Hola!
