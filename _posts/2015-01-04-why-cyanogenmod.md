Why Cyanogenmod? I get this question from my friends a lot. Read on to know the answer. Cyanogenmod is a Custom ROM for android smartphones. You can compare this to Windows 7 while Stock android is XP. This is just for understanding. Cyanogenmod is highly customizable and faster than conventional android OS. If you havent tried Cyanogenmod then please do try! There are a lot of cool stuff going on.

Smartphone manufacturers and Network Carriers include some crappy apps (bloatware) inbuilt while delivering it to the market. They eat up a lot of space and run all the time draining your battery. CyanogenMod gets rid of such unwanted apps.

## <span id="2_Security">2. Security</span>

The last time Koushik Dutta (one of the founders of CM) spoke, he mentioned that he may get warnings from NSA. Cyanogenmod completely encrypts your data, only end users can decode the message. This is not appreciated by the government by the way.

There is inbuilt app security as well. You can secure any folder containing apps with a pattern. In order to open the apps that are in the folder, you should know the pattern. You cannot access those apps anywhere else on the phone.

The folder on the home screen has four apps and you can see a lock icon at the bottom right corner of the folder. You can click on it to lock all four apps in the folder.

Once you click on the lock icon, you&#8217;ll see below screen.

[<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/folder-lock2.png?resize=169%2C300" alt="folder-lock2" data-recalc-dims="1" />](/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/folder-lock2.png)

Select a pattern you like and you&#8217;ll be directed to next screen shown below.

Here if you want to lock the apps you have to click on the lock icon on the top-right corner.

Most carriers take months to update devices on their network to the latest version of Android, if ever. Taking control of your OS allows you to update whenever you feel like. For Moto G users, there is Android Lollipop 5.0 already available by cyanogenmod 12.

This is again not appreciated by Carriers because users don&#8217;t buy new phones if they get immediate updates to the old phones.

## <span id="4_Highly_customizable">4. Highly customizable</span>

This feature is what I like the most in Cyanogenmod. You can change almost all the looks and feel in your phone. There are hundreds of themes available in Playstore. Customization level is so high that you can choose icons from one theme, font from another, style from another. There is an option to change the bootanimation as well.

Here are the screenshots where I have used a CM theme from playstore.

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-191" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/settings-338x300.jpg?fit=338%2C300" alt="settings" data-recalc-dims="1" />](/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/settings.jpg)

This is a Material theme with nice Green overlay. Find the theme [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ind.aang.minimal.teal&hl=en)

## <span id="5_Performance">5. Performance</span>

This might be the greatest feature of Cyanogenmod. By tweaking the kernel here and there, CM team manages to give a pretty good performance far better than stock ROM. You can set the frequency yourself (though I don&#8217;t recommend it) for a better performance. Frequency can be set to lower values to save battery life.

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-187" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/performance-169x300.jpg?fit=169%2C300" alt="performance" data-recalc-dims="1" />](/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/performance.jpg)

Now cyanogenmod has more than 8 million users (registered) and hardware partners Oppo, One plus one.

I have been following up with cyanogenmod since its inception. The only thing that bothered CM users was the process of installing CM. It&#8217;s so hard that some guys don&#8217;t even dare to attempt. Noticing this problem, CM has come up with [one click installer](http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/CyanogenMod_Installer). Installing CM has never been easier. If your phone supports CM then give it a try. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll like it.

Moto G users can go [here](http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Falcon_Info) to have a look at the procedure to install Cyanogenmod.

If you are also using Cyanogenmod then leave a comment on your experience of using CM, Why you like/hate it?

Thanks for reading!
