The cost of giving attention to details is finding mistakes in a movie. I can assure that for the modern educated class, small mistakes do matter. At this point, this class isn't huge but soon it will be.

Not so long ago I was so naive that I used to believe all the stunts pulled off by Indian movie stars. I was dumbstruck when a [Telugu actor broke stone pillars](https://youtu.be/EmJQABJ7sUk?t=282){: target="_blank"} with his bare hand! **Newtons third law of motion** states that 

> If you punch a stone pillar with bare hands then you will have to rely on your other hand for months.

It was time to do the math. I did some research and filtered out some data. The closest I got was this.

This guy breaks comparatively a small stone and not with his knuckles.

That was it. I had to say goodbye to most of the Telugu movies. After this incident, I weigh every movie with laws of nature. If a director shows anything out of ordinary, there better should be an explanation for it.

**6-5=2** is one such case. I don't mind the girl floating mid air with no one lifting her. It happens because of a super-natural power.


## Why I'm concerned

No movie is perfect. They have their own ups and downs but nobody cares about them after coming out of theaters. But, it concerns me deeply when cult movies - which we want to watch at least 10 times again - have a mistake. We all know that even **The Dark Knight** has some mistakes. I'm showing one of them here.

Ok, that wasn't so observable. An average viewer misses this part. I missed it. This sort of tiny mistakes may seem big compared to the mistakes in Gravity movie pointed out by Neil deGrass Tyson.

I don't mind such things in a Sci-Fi movie which has got so many things right. Hollywood avoids and gets rid of most of the mistakes in pre-production. They employ a lot of people to work on different aspects of a movie. They do get the revenue back. 

Whereas in Indian movies, the number of audiences is a fraction of that unless it is a Rajinikanth movie. There are directors who have finished shooting a movie within a week! So Indian movies do not have a dedicated team for everything. Maybe there is one person per unit (except for [S. Narayan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrpPGh2IQo){: target="_blank"}).

When I say cult movies, there aren't a lot of them. If we look at Kannada film industry there are a few movies that can be called as cult movies. One such movies is [**Ulidavaru Kandanthe**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3394420/){: target="_blank"}.

I found some mistakes but I will mention some of them

### The reflector guy

This mistake is seen throughout the movie because the Rayban glasses are used in many shots.

### The Bhangi Scene

Observe the Beedi, before and after.

Let me know if there are more of them. It hurts because the movie is my all time favorite. I will be watching this many many times. [Rakshit Shetty](https://www.facebook.com/TheRakshitShetty/){: target="_blank"} who has been so meticulous in the whole movie should have given some more attention to these silly things.

Even if he gets all the mistakes corrected, the movie will not earn more than what it did but that would have made the movie much enjoyable.

## What can be done

### Course correction
Having a team of experts to judge the movie frame by frame. This will definitely solve most of the mistakes but having them in the set could prevent the mistakes from happening.

### Expert opinion
An Indian movie basically is a perspective of the director and assistant director. Things can easily go un-noticed. So having critiques could help better themselves and the movie.

### Technology
Nowadays you can achieve things that were impossible just a few years ago. Anything can be corrected with CGI. This might demand more funds than the budget.

### Improving stunts team
Indian movie stunts are way exaggerated. A man cannot easily lift another man. A kick doesn't usually push anyone into the air unless they are already flying. A car(SUV, Tata Sumo) never flies or explodes just by shooting it. A helicopter and a Tata Sumo do not collide(Magadeera). Newton's laws apply everywhere(to Rohit Shetty).

A fight should be realistic. I don't have to give an example from Bourne series. Take **Mungaru Male** for instance, there is hardly any fight but the one they have looks very real. Nobody flies.(read Period!)

I'm happy to see that the sound of a punch or kick has taken a shift from literal **"Dishoom"** to an actual thump sound(not every Indian movie).

This is an unfinished business. More mistakes coming up.

**Comment the most bizarre mistake that you have seen in a movie.**
