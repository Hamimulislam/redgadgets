Today Whatsapp has solved one of the major problems I had, using Whatsapp from my computer. There are times when I&#8217;m working on my PC, keeping my phone for charging in a different room or at a distance. If I get a message on Whatsapp, I have to go all the way to the other room, reply to the message and come back to resume my work on PC. This is annoying if I&#8217;m getting frequent messages.

**Whatsapp web** is a new feature for **Google Chrome** users to get Whatsapp notifications on the browser itself. If you configure it once, you don&#8217;t have to keep your phone with you all the time. The only thing you have to make sure is that your mobile and PC are connected to the internet. Whatsapp also has announced voice call features coming soon. Voice calls from a PC sounds great isn&#8217;t it?!

i-Phone users may have to wait for a while to get this feature. There are compatibility issues to be sorted out. But you can see how it&#8217;s done.

Let&#8217;s see how to use WhatsApp from desktop.

**Step 1:** Update your Whatsapp application. If you already have an updated WhatsApp application then click on Options. If you see an option **Whatsapp Web** in the drop-down then you are good to go. Otherwise backup WhatsApp by **Options>>Settings>>Chat settings>>Backup conversations** then uninstall and reinstall WhatsApp.

**Step 2:** Fire up your Chrome browser and go to the link <a href="https://web.whatsapp.com/" target="_blank">https://web.whatsapp.com/</a>. Now you&#8217;ll see a QR code that needs to be scanned from your smartphone. To do that, open WhatsApp on your phone go to **Options>>Whatsapp Web**. You get an option to scan QR-code. Scan the QR-code shown on the Browser with your phone. It&#8217;ll automatically detect the user.
