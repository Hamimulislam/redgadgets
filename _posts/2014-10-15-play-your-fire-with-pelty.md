Pelty creates its power from the heat of a single candle, which is claimed sufficient to produce enough energy to run the built-in Bluetooth speaker unit for up to 5 hours. The speaker used in the prototype is a full range 3 in (7.6 cm) driver, with a nominal impedance of 8 Ohms and a power rating of 12 W RMS. It costs around $230.

## Bluetooth speaker powered by fire!

Pelty represents a technological revolution in the high-quality audio speakersâ€™ market. Pelty is innovative and unique in the world because it is powered exclusively by a wax candle. Thanks to a patented technology based on the Peltier effect, it transforms the thermal energy of the fire of a candle into electric energy able to turn on the speaker and amplify the music. The wireless bluetooh technology and the total absence of wires make of Pelty an object of complicated technological design.

Its line, essential and elegant, with a taste of pure Made in Italy, makes of Pelty a device that combines advanced technology and a very accurate choice of artisanal quality materials like ceramic and glass.

The possibility to personalize it in many different colors satisfies every taste. The total absence of batteries and electric energy makes it eco-friendly; thanks to the simplicity of its use, you can bring Pelty everywhere a unique and embracing atmosphere is needed: fire, music, and Italian excellence altogether.
