This question was popping up in my mind every time I visit xda-developers page or listening to my friends talking about how they rooted their smartphone. Why should I do it? I&#8217;m happy with the experience I&#8217;m having in the pure form of Moto G (except for battery backup).  Why should I risk bricking my phone or getting my warranty void?

After brainstorming a lot, I came up with this.

# You should root your Moto G

Why?

I had only one problem with Moto G. That was battery back up. Let me show you how rooting solved that problem.

If you are familiar with running apps in android, you may have seen that a lot of apps which you don&#8217;t use will be running in the background. Some of them are system apps that you may never use. Some apps are the ones you have installed. You can actually stop them, but they auto-start in a while without even asking your permission!

What the hell?! I&#8217;m already low on  my battery and Google Maps is running in the background to hog all the juice left. This is insane. Now I had to make a choice. **I have to root my Moto G**.

I have a explained the procedure of unlocking moto G bootloader here <a href="http://redgadgets.com/how-to-make-your-moto-g-super-awesome/" target="_blank">How to root Moto G</a>. You can refer the &#8216;Rooting&#8217; part of it. Moto G unlock procedure may seem harder in the beginning but after some trials you&#8217;ll be an expert. Unlike jailbreaking iOS, rooting gives you a lot of options to customize your smartphone.

Once the rooting is done. I knew exactly what I should be doing.

First app I installed was <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rootuninstaller.free&hl=en" target="_blank">Root Uninstaller</a>.

This app does what it says. You can uninstall almost all the apps including system apps. If you see some app that you don&#8217;t use in months, then you should consider uninstalling it. It will save you some space and battery life.

Second app I installed was <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oasisfeng.greenify&hl=en" target="_blank">Greenify</a>.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-661" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/greenify1.jpg?fit=300%2C533" alt="greenify" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/greenify1.jpg?resize=169%2C300 169w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/greenify1.jpg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" />

Not many people make use of this app. This is really an awesome utility if you know how to use it. Greenify lists all the apps that run in the background and lets you stops any app from running in the background. The app you stopped in Greenify will not run again unless you start it. And when you exit the app, it will be stopped from running in the background by Greenify. This app almost doubled my battery life!

Do not use an autokiller. That will not help save your battery.

These are the apps just to improve battery life. There are hundreds of apps especially for rooted phones that can do a lot of other things that can enhance performance and even some visual elements. You do not have to install a custom ROM to get new features. I recommend using <a href="http://redgadgets.com/how-to-make-your-moto-g-super-awesome/" target="_blank">Xposed Framework</a> to customize your phone the way you want it to be.

Finally, it&#8217;s good to root your android phone and use some tricks to get things done. Do not worry about bricking your phone, you can always un-brick it. Go root your phone now and let me know what cool thing you did with it.
