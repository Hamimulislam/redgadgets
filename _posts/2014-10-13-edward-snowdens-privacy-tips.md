According to [Edward Snowden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden), people who care about their privacy should stay away from popular consumer Internet services like [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), and [Google](https://www.google.com).

> When you say, ‘I have nothing to hide,’ you’re saying, ‘I don’t care about this right.’ You’re saying, ‘I don’t have this right, because I’ve got to the point where I have to justify it.’ The way rights work is, the government has to justify its intrusion into your rights.

In a [June blog post](https://blog.dropbox.com/2014/06/weve-got-your-back/) related to Snowden, [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) actually says, &#8220;All files sent and retrieved from Dropbox are encrypted while traveling between you and our servers,&#8221; as well as when they&#8217;re &#8220;at rest on our servers,&#8221; and it points to other security measures that the company is taking. The difference between [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) and [SpiderOak](https://spideroak.com/), as explained elsewhere, is that [SpiderOak](https://spideroak.com/) encrypts the data while it&#8217;s on your computer, as opposed to only encrypting it &#8220;in transit&#8221; and on the company&#8217;s servers.

> We&#8217;re talking about encryption. We&#8217;re talking about dropping programs that are hostile to privacy. For example, [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)? Get rid of [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), it doesn&#8217;t support encryption, it doesn&#8217;t protect your private files. And use competitors like SpiderOak, that do the same exact service but they protect the content of what you&#8217;re sharing.

He also suggested that while [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) and [Google](https://www.google.com) have improved their security, they remain “dangerous services” that people should avoid. (Somewhat amusingly, anyone watching the interview via Google Hangout or YouTube saw a Google logo above Snowden’s face as he said this.) His final piece of advice on this front: Don’t send unencrypted text messages, but instead use services like [RedPhone](https://whispersystems.org/) and [Silent Circle](https://silentcircle.com/).

> We can have secret programs. You know, the American people don’t have to know the name of every individual that’s under investigation. We don’t need to know the technical details of absolutely every program in the intelligence community. But we do have to know the bare and broad outlines of the powers our government is claiming, and how they affect us and how they affect our relationships overseas. Because if we don’t, we are no longer citizens, we no longer have leaders. We’re subjects, and we have rulers.
