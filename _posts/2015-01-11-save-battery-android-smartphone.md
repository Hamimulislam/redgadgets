This question is asked by many of the android users I have encountered. Android smartphones are really smart but not so much in saving battery life for a whole day. As the displays got bigger and bigger, the amount of power they use also got higher. It&#8217;s not how big the battery is but how smartly the power is utilized to run the device. Read on to know how you can save some juice and last your battery life for a whole day.
  

If you are using any task killer app like &#8216;**Advanced Task Killer**&#8216; then please get rid of it. Android OS manages tasks very well. You cannot help apps running in the background. Even if a task killer stops a process, it&#8217;s going to restart in some time. Task killer stops it again. This process repeats and it may eat up more battery than it saves.

Do you have a rooted phone? That&#8217;s good. Then check out some must know ways to save battery life at the end of this post.

First things first, what is using up your battery life? Is it your display? Is it the voice calls you make? Is it Wi-Fi that&#8217;s left turned on? Is it google maps?
  
Finding the root cause is important here.

There can be many reasons for battery drain

**1. Unwanted processes running in the background:** a majority of the battery drain issues are because of background apps.

**2. Turned on features that are not in use:** many users don&#8217;t turn off their Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth etc., even if they are not using it.

**3. Screen Brightness and screen time-out:** brighter the screen, more battery it&#8217;s going to use.

**4. Haptic feedback and Vibration mode:** the motor that is used to vibrate the phone takes up more power than a normal speaker would.

**5. Background data sync:** this feature will eat more battery if it is running with mobile data.

**6. App notifications and alerts:** apps like Whatsapp, facebook, twitter, Weather widgets need to fetch updates from an external server. The alert frequency (wake-clock) can also affect battery life.

**7. Weak signal:** If you make a call when the signal is low then the mobile is going to use a significant amount of power to catch the signal and keep the call-up.

**8. Apps with ads:** they use the internet data to show ads. Power consumption is not much but if you are a gamer then it could be significant.

**9. Live wallpapers:** live wallpapers uses extra processing for animation and thus results in battery drain.

# Remedy

**1. Unwanted processes running in the background:** By navigating to **Settings>>Applications>>Running** you can see all the apps that are running. Carefully observe which apps are running all the time which you don&#8217;t even use. Many a times pre-installed apps from OEM and network carriers are the culprits. If you find such app then click on it, &#8216;clear data&#8217; and disable it. By doing so, the app will never run again. If you really want that app back, you can always navigate to **Settings>>Applications>>All** and scroll all the way to the bottom where you see disabled apps. Click on them and enable.

**2. Turned on features that are not in use:** Turn off all the features that are not in use.

**3. Screen Brightness and screen time-out:** Set the screen brightness to **&#8216;auto&#8217;**. Set the screen timeout time to a lesser value, say 30 seconds.

**4. Haptic feedback and Vibration mode:** Goto **Setiings>>Sound** and uncheck **Dial Pad touch tones**, **Touch sounds**, **Screen lock sound**, **Vibrate on touch**, **Volume adjustment sound**, **Vibrate on notification** etc., Keep your phone in Ringer Mode or silent if vibration is not necessary.

**5. Background data sync:** You can turn off **Background Data Sync** but you&#8217;ll not receive any updates from the apps like gmail, messenger etc., Choose this option only if your battery is dying. Many a times back-up will run on your device every time there is a new photo or video. Either select not to backup or set the back-up to happen only on Wi-Fi as Wi-Fi consumes less power than mobile data. Be aware of automatic app updates. This option is found in **&#8216;Google Play&#8217;** app. You can stop this in settings option in the app or you can set the updates to happen only over Wi-Fi.

**6. App notifications and alerts:** Uncheck the &#8216;show notification&#8217; option for the apps which you may not want any updates. You can do it by navigating to **Settings>>Applications** and click on the app which you may not want any updates from.

Many apps like Weather widgets have a shorter refresh time. Go to options in those apps and set a longer &#8216;Refresh interval&#8217;, say once in 3 hours.

**7. Weak signal:** This is out of our control. Be in a place where network strength is good while making a call.

**8. Apps with ads:** Try to use apps without ads or try to buy ad-free apps.

**9. Live wallpapers:** Do not use a live wallpaper. It may look really good but it is a hog on battery life.

**10.** If the smartphone display is **AMOLED**, then use a black background. To see how, refer this <a href="http://redgadgets.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-latest-nexus-6/" target="_blank">post</a>

# What about rooted smartphones?!

Rooted android phones have many advantages over unrooted ones. To know more see the post [why cyanogenmod](http://redgadgets.com/why-cyanogenmod/)

  1. If your phone is rooted then first thing you have to do is to install a root &#8216;uninstaller app&#8217; through which we are going to uninstall all those crappy apps from OEM and Network carriers.</p> 
  2. Install **greenify**! Greenify is way different than a task killer. A task killer kills a task which is running but greenify hibernates an app and never allow it to start on its own. The only way to start the hibernated app is to click on it. This way I was able to stop the ever running &#8216;Google maps&#8217; application running in the background all the time. One more advantage is that once you exit from an app, it&#8217;ll be automatically hibernated by greenify!

  3. Use **Custom Roms** that are made to save battery life, Eg: CyanogenMod, Slim Roms. See how you can <a href="http://redgadgets.com/how-to-make-your-moto-g-super-awesome/" target="_blank">install cyanogenmod on MOTO G</a>. The procedure is similar to almost all the android smartphones.

  4. Set the **CPU frequency** and **CPU governor** to a lower and power saving value (This is not recommended considering the life of the processor) but by setting a lower frequency value you can save a lot of juice but your phone may become a little laggy at times. I don&#8217;t recommend doing this if you are a gamer as games are supposed to use the full processing speed.

For a longer battery life, drain the battery completely before you recharge it. If above methods are not working for you then use a spare battery or a power bank.
