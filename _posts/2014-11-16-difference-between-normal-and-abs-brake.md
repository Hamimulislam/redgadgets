Nature tries to teach us many things. There is always a better way than the ones way we are following.

Imagine how a plant can produce food out of sunlight **carbon dioxide**, **water** and **minerals**! This must be the ultimate technology that we can possibly find. Not to forget it&#8217;s by-product **Oxygen**.

How clean is that!

Why can&#8217;t we think of a solution to the problems in a &#8216;natural&#8217; way? Let&#8217;s build a tree. We are technically so advanced that we are building a tree, a big tree with leafs of length around 5 meters! Let&#8217;s say it can suck **CO_2_** in a significant scale. It gives out **O_2_** as a by-product. It produces a huge pile of **Mash potatoes** every day!

Seems like a science fiction right. But there could be a day when every house will have this panel (leaf) on their house which produces **Oxygen**, **Energy** and **Food** for them!

We just have to go along with nature, not against it. Nature will embrace us rather killing us by Tsunami.

Now this is no more science fiction. We have the technology that works like a real leaf (cannot produce mash potatoes yet).

This artificial leaf can breathe. It takes in Co2 and gives out O2. This is the future space travel and saving human race!
