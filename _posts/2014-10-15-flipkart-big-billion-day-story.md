A lot of people have expressed their resentment towards Flipkart. I have a different story to share. Read on.

I have been looking to buy a decent phone for quite a long time now. I heard about Flipkart&#8217;s big Billion day and was waiting for it. So I got up early in the morning and logged into Flipkart. When I saw it I was shocked. I had never seen such an offer before and never was going to believe that I will ever see an offer like this in my life time. I was feeling blessed when I realized I was going to save so much and also have a new sexy mobile phone.Really dream come true moment for me.

Meanwhile, I was also having so many plans on how to spend this 1 Re I was going to save. My friends were telling me to invest it in Mutual funds ( of course, only the remaining money left with me after I treat them). My Dad wanted to buy me a new car with this money. I was feeling like Rajinikanth in Sivaji the Boss for the whole time. But ..

Then my dreams came crashing down. There was some technical glitch and I could not buy the phone.

Now I am all heart broken, ruminating those wonderful moments where I was just inches away from realizing my dreams of owning a good phone bought at a price astonishingly lower than its actual price.While writing this, tears roll down my eyes. Such is life.I wish I get lucky on some other big billion day.

PS: one more funny offer someone found out.

50k Rs. Pendrive. Now you will ALWAYS remove safely ðŸ˜€

Ordered a TV in a 30-minute sale, paid by card, with a &#8220;no cancellation&#8221; clause. And then Flipkart cancelled it.

A slipper&#8217;s MRP is Rs.194. But they have mentioned the MRP as Rs.399 that has 52%off and the final price is Rs.148 !
