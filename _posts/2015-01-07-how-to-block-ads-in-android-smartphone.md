If you are using an android smartphone, the ads that display on browsers, apps and pre-roll ads on youtube are very annoying! There are solutions for ads on PC such as using an ad-blocker plugin (I personally don&#8217;t recommend using ad-blockers anywhere. Along with blocking the ads, ad-blocker blocks the income of many bloggers, app developers etc. and prevents promotion of any product or service. Nobody wins here. Think twice before you jump in)

So if you have rooted your android smartphone, then it&#8217;s easy to find an ad-blocker in playstore and install it. If you don&#8217;t find one, here&#8217;s the detailed procedure for doing it. I have tried Adblock mobile app on android, but it doesn&#8217;t block all the ads. Adblock on iOS and android while browsing is possible with Mercury Browser. It has an in-built option to block ads. Give it a try.

##What do you need?
  
1. A rooted smartphone. Read [Why you should root Moto G](http://redgadgets.com/why-should-i-root-my-moto-g/)
  
2. [Xposed Framework installed](http://redgadgets.com/how-to-make-your-moto-g-super-awesome/).
  
3. MinminGuard Xposed Module &#8211; can be downloaded once you install Xposed Framework.

First two steps are covered here: [How to Root Moto G](http://redgadgets.com/how-to-make-your-moto-g-super-awesome/)

After you have installed Xposed Framework, open up the app, go to &#8216;Downloads&#8217;, click on search and then type in minminGuard. Once you see the module available in the search results, install it.

Now in Xposed Framework, go to modules, check minminGuard. In minminGuard, you can opt the apps for which you don&#8217;t want any ads to appear.
