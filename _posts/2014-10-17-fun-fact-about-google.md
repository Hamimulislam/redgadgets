**Google** when spelled backwards becomes **elgooG**, But the interesting fact is we can also use http://www.elgoog.im for our searches.

&#8211; **elgooG** is the mirror image of Google search engine; not only is all of its content a reversal of Google, the search terms must also be written in reverse order to yield the desired results.

  * Though created for fun purpose, it found practical use in the People&#8217;s Republic of China after the domestic banning of Google, as it circumvented the government firewalls.

It is definitely worth a try.
