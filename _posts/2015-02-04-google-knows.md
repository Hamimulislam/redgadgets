Based on your browsing habits, Google collects some data that might be helpful to deliver related ads and contents to you. It also collects your locations by monitoring your travel habits. Google knows where you work and where you live.


Let&#8217;s see what are the data collected by google that you may never knew they did!


# <span id="1_Your_Preferences">1. Your Preferences</span>

Navigate to <a href="http://google.com/ads/preferences" target="_blank">http://google.com/ads/preferences</a> to see what Google serves you when you are online.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-540" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/google1-11.jpg?fit=700%2C560" alt="google1-1" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/google1-11.jpg?resize=375%2C300 375w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/02/google1-11.jpg?w=853 853w" sizes="(max-width: 853px) 100vw, 853px" data-recalc-dims="1" />](/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/google1-11.jpg)

You&#8217;ll be surprised to see that Google knows a lot more than you thought it would!

It knows your gender ( no big deal )

It knows your Age ( Err. . ok )

It knows what you are interested in ( oh no! )

Don&#8217;t worry you can always change it by clicking on &#8216;Edit&#8217; or you can completely &#8216;Opt out&#8217; of it. If you opt out, you&#8217;ll be served with unrelated ads in the future.

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-541" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/google2-600x221.jpg?fit=600%2C221" alt="google opt out" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/google2.jpg?resize=600%2C221 600w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/02/google2.jpg?w=887 887w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" />](/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/google2.jpg)

Ok, that&#8217;s not scary. .

Have fun accessing this link on your friends PC or smartphone.



# <span id="6_Finally_an_option_to_download_all_this">6. Finally an option to download all this</span>

Google lets you download all the data that you have on google account like bookmarks, mail, contacts, chats, blogs, photos, youtube videos and what not.
  
<a href="https://www.google.com/takeout" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/takeout</a>
  
[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-558" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/google-download-all-data.jpg?fit=700%2C710" alt="google-download-all-data" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/google-download-all-data.jpg?resize=296%2C300 296w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/02/google-download-all-data.jpg?w=732 732w" sizes="(max-width: 732px) 100vw, 732px" data-recalc-dims="1" />](/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/google-download-all-data.jpg)

Seems like google knows me more than my girlfriend does! But the only thing that makes me still stick to google is the **privacy**. Google does not give out data to a third party. <a href="http://redgadgets.com/edward-snowdens-privacy-tips/" target="_blank">Edward Snowden</a> revealed that NSA has access to all these data through MUSCULAR surveillance program. But again until it&#8217;s proven right, I&#8217;ll be using google services.

Thanks for reading!
