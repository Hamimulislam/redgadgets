Vietnamese blog [Tinhte.vn](https://www.tinhte.vn/threads/hinh-anh-day-co-phai-la-mo-hinh-cua-ipad-air-moi.2371061/#9to5mac) (via [9to5Mac](http://9to5mac.com/2014/10/08/ipad-air-2-leaks/)) is showing off pictures of what it claims is the next generation of the Apple tablet.

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-168" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ipad_air_2-6-451x300.jpg?fit=300%2C200" alt="ipad_air_2-6" data-recalc-dims="1" />](/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ipad_air_2-6.jpg)

The leaks show the next generation iPad to be mostly identical to the current iPad Air, but with some notable changes. Aside from thinness, the iPad now features a ‘glass’ (likely sapphire) Touch ID home button to match previous rumors. Interestingly, the side shots of the device appear to lack a mute switch.

It isn’t clear what stage of development this **iPad Air 2** is from. From the pictures, it doesn’t seem like a mere dummy unit, but the poor finish on the back side appears to suggest this is somewhat of a prototype and not ‘final’ hardware. However, the video almost certainly depicts a dummy unit, which may offer an alternative explanation for the lack of mute switch (simply incomplete dummy)
