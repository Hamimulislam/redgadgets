A quantum dot (QD) is a nanocrystal made of semiconductor materials that is small enough to exhibit quantum mechanical properties. Ok that&#8217;s way too technical. Imagine QDs as crystals that emit specific light. Something similar to OLED. But this is the technology of future! Read on to see why.

CES 2015 has flashed some of the QD displays that are very bright and close to real colors. Nothing fancy, the technology has been around since 1990. You can simplify the whole thing by saying QDs is a different kind of back-light!

Have you ever noticed the warmth when you keep your hands on a TV display that&#8217;s been on for a while? That is because TV displays have a back-light which has full color range, not just red, green and blue. It&#8217;ll have red, blue, green, yellow, purple and many other colored lights including other wavelengths like Infrared (which causes heat). Normally it is filtered before the light hits the screen. But while doing so, a lot of heat is generated.
  
Now enters the Quantum Dot screen, no heat, the crystals emit their own light. Imagine the power this technology is going to save. If it hits the mobile displays, battery life is going to expand for hours.

# AMOLED vs Quantum Dot

Ok if AMOLED itself is a battery saving display, why we need QDs on mobile phones? AMOLEDs are not very bright outdoors whereas QDs are very bright and outdoor visibility is the best among all kinds of screens we have seen so far. This is where QD shines. You&#8217;ll be seeing QD display smartphone in a year or two.<h1Other Applications</h1> 

More than on displays, QDs find applications in a number of other fields:
  
**QD bulbs**: QD bulbs can produce true day light luminescence. Saves more power than a LED bulb and emits much brighter light.
  
**Photovoltaic devices**: Quantum dots may be able to increase the efficiency and reduce the cost of today&#8217;s typical silicon photovoltaic cells.
  
**LEDs**: More efficient than the LEDs we currently have. That&#8217;s how it got into TVs.

Do you think QDs can take over other forms of display? Let us know in the comment section.

Thanks!
