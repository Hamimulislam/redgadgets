It is universally accepted fact that **torrents** is the best way to find latest movies, but you have to wait till it gets downloaded and download speed depends on the seeds.

The easier way to find a movie or a latest TV show is by harnessing the unmatchable potential of google search engine to find things.

Let&#8217;s see how it is done.

Here is the recipe:

<pre>"MOVIE NAME” -inurl:(htm|html|php|pls|&lt;wbr />txt) intitle:index.of “last modified” (mkv|mp4|avi)</pre>

Copy the above search term. Change the &#8220;MOVIE NAME HERE&#8221; field to whatever movie you want to find. Paste it in Google search engine. Hit enter. You should see a list of search results with &#8216;Index&#8217; list.

For example, I searched for &#8216;**Game of Thrones**&#8216;. I was looking for some episodes of season 5 which has got leaked recently.


Click on one of the results and see if the movie you searched is there in the index list. If not try next search result. You should find your movie in one of those.

After going through some of the links, I found what I was looking for.

The best part is &#8211; apart from finding the episodes &#8211; that I was using Google Chrome browser which can play media files! So I was able to watch them on the browser itself without downloading anything. You can make the browser full-screen for a media player experience.

This trick works for all kinds of files.

**Mp3:**

<pre>“SONG NAME” -inurl:(htm|html|php|pls|txt)&lt;wbr /> intitle:index.of “last modified” (mp3|wma|aac|flac)</pre>

&nbsp;

You can observe that the only part that is changed is file format. So whatever file you are looking for, replace the format and search.
