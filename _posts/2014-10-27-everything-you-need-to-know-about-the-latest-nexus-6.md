After so many rumours and leaks, the Nexus 6 has revealed itself in all its glory.

## <span id="Mega_Moto_X">Mega Moto X</span>

Google&#8217;s new phone doesn&#8217;t look anything like its predecessors, but it has a rather uncanny resemblance to the Moto X. In fact, it looks almost exactly like a blown-up version of Motorola&#8217;s flagship, with only a few exceptions.

The screen isn&#8217;t just big &#8212; it&#8217;s as high-definition as you can get these days, thanks to the Quad HD AMOLED panel. That&#8217;s 2,560 x 1,440 pixels spread over the 5.96-inch display, which comes out to a pixel density of 493 ppi. When turned on and set to the lowest possible brightness, the display changes to a pinkish glow. This actually comes in incredibly handy when trying to read something in a pitch dark room.

### <span id="What8217s_AMOLED">What&#8217;s AMOLED?</span>

Active Matrix Organic Light Emitting Diode, technology has grown in popularity in recent years. AMOLED screens consist of a thin layer of organic polymers that light up when zapped with an electric current. Due to this simple construction, AMOLED screens can be extremely thin and do not require a backlight. The benefit of losing a backlight is readily apparent: these screens are able to produce blacks so deep that the screen pixels can shut right off. Shutting off pixels can also save electricity and battery life in phones and tablets. Just keep your backgrounds close to black and you’ll save energy!

Cons: Poor viewability in direct sunlight.

In good light, it&#8217;s able to get shots decently fast and the results are sharp. But even with OIS, low light can be a little bit of a challenge but it should be better than its predecessor at taking low-light shots thanks to its f/2.0 aperture (a bump up from f/2.4 on the N5).

Taking pictures using HDR mode requires a bit of patience; it takes a few seconds to switch into HDR from regular mode, and once you fire off a shot, it takes an unusually long time to process. This can be frustrating when compared to many other devices capable of processing HDR in real-time, so you can even see what the photo will look like before you&#8217;ve even taken it. Not so here.

## <span id="Project_Volta_for_a_better_battery_life">Project Volta for a better battery life!</span>

Even as smartphones are getting bigger and better, battery life is often an issue. Google announced today at I/O that its upcoming version of Android includes &#8220;Project Volta&#8221; to tackle the problem head-on. A &#8220;Battery Historian&#8221; gives more info on exactly what&#8217;s draining energy, while a battery saver mode lets users squeeze up to an extra 90 minutes out of each charge by doing things like lowering the screen refresh rate.
